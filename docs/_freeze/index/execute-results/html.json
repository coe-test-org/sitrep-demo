Some recombinations from JN.1 and other BA.5 variants are being monitoredtracked, but have yet to show significant growth relative other variants.\n- Together this diversity suggests steady evolution against general population immunity with no indications of a variant driven wave of COVID-19 infections. \n- As of MM/DD/YYYY, there were X samples from MM/DD/YYYY - MM/DD/YYYY, some comment on trend\n- Some text here about image one. There is this variant that's here\n- Some text about image two\n- Image 3 has this\n- Findings from a site's analysis of national data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< embed notebooks/nwcoe.qmd#fig-countprop >}}\n\n\n{{< embed notebooks/necoe.qmd#fig-state-analysis >}}\n\n\n{{< embed notebooks/vacoe.qmd#fig-fatality-plot >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Site Summaries \n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n# Here you can write code that can be used as inline text\n# See the variant proportions values below in the summary\n# Those values are not hard-coded/written.

Raw sequencing data is assembled into consensus genomes using publicly available bioinformatics pipeline, and the consensus genomes are uploaded to public repositories like GISAID and GenBank. This report demonstrates how the NW PGCoE utilizes SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data to monitor emerging variants biweekly, forecast emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, and infers relative abundance estimates of SARS-CoV-2 variants in the wastewater. Previous work that looked at the disease severity of SARS-CoV-2 variants is currently being implemented to analyze the disease severity of current variants utilizing hospitalization data. This work is ongoing and will be presented at a later time.\n",
